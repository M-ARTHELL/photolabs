# Photolabs
A project built during the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Flex Course to teach students about React.

Clicking on a photo will bring up a modal showing a larger version of the image alongside other similar images.

Clicking on a topic will filter and display phoros relating to that topic.

Users can favorite photos by clicking the heart button that's added to them. Doing so will update the heart in the navbar to show a small notification icon.
